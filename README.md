## About
The goal of this project was to create a timed quiz that starts at the click of a button. Once started, a timer will appear and countdown from 75 seconds. Each question should display on screen for the user and when they choose an answer choice a message should display either correct or incorrect. If they choose incorrectly, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer. Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the user is redirected to a scores page. There they can save their score to a leaderboard using their intials.
